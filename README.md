# Tiara
Neopixel Tiara w/WiFi Control UI

This project was inspired by [Becky Stern's](https://beckystern.com/) [NeoPixel Tiara](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-tiara), with some changes to the hardware.
The control board is an ESP8266 [D1 Mini](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html) combined with a [Battery Shield](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1_mini_shield/battery.html).  Software was written using the Arduino IDE.

The "gems" in the Tiara are from AliExpress; [small](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33026835790.html) "gem" & [large](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32835427711.html) "gem".
